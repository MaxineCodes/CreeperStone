### A silly Wolfenstein3D-style "Minecraft" spinoff game made in PyGame.

`main.py` is located in the `./Game` directory, along with GameInstance-specific code.

Code not related to the instance themselves ("Core files") are located in the `./GameCore` directory.

### Is this in any way related to Mojang or the "Minecraft" Game? 
- Ofcourse not lol. It's a doodle in coding form.
